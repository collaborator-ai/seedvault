## Versioning

Any significant functional change to the CLI (`client/package.json`) or the server (`server/package.json`) must include an appropriate semver bump:
- **patch** for bug fixes and internal reliability improvements
- **minor** for new features or backward-compatible behavior changes
- **major** for breaking API or config changes
